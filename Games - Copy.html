    <h1>Games Are Fun But...</h1>
    <a href="Bens Rant Vent Blog.html">Home</a>
    <p>Now dont get me wrong, I love games. But sometimes they have some improvement do be done</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Among us</h2>
    <br>
    <p>For starters, I think among us is a great game, but there are a few features they should add (THIS IS MY OPINION). For the first thing they should add, is a custom avatar uploader. They could have like a thing where you edit a plain white template and uploadit and then you have a custom skin!</p>
    <br>
    <p>The next thing they could add is a currency system, and when you win you get points and you can buy special items when you earn enough points.</p>
