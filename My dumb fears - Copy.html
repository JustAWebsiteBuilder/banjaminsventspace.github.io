    <h1>My Super Dumb Fears</h1>
    <a href="Bens Rant Vent Blog.html">Home</a>
    <p>Well, I have my fair share of dumb fears and i want to vent about the dumbest ones I have</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Lizards</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Starting things off with my fear of lizards. But the thing is, I don't have a fear of snakes or any other reptile, it's just lizards. Now I might have a memorie when this might have started. So i was coming home from my friend's house and was at my front door, when i notice this hella big lizard. It was like 1 foot long and thats long from where I live. So when I saw it, i ran off screaming (I was like 7 at the time). My mom came out and was like What's Wrong? And I was like "AAAAAAA..." When my mom saw it she said "Wow, Thats B I G!" And thats all i remember.</p><br>
    <p> So thats how my lizard fear started.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Dead Animals</h2>
    <p>I have a <b>INTENSE</b> fear of dead animals. And the thing is, I dont even know when it started. But I guess i can talk about it a little.</p><br>
    <p>So like i said, I have no idea when this fear started, but i can tell you some stories. So for the first one I was around 6 and i went into the garage woth my grand-ma, and as i was walking i noticed a <b><i>DEAD BLOODY MOUSE ON THE FLOOR!</i></b>So I ran back into the house and was <b>S H O O K I T H.</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>Now for the second story, I was going to let our one of our 4 cats, And her name is Delta, and when i saw her, she had a bird bigger than her head. And when i saw that i was like ಠ_ಠ. And thats all!</p>
